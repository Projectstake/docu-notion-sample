Issues detail the work required for a project. Each issue tracks a specific task, bug, or error. We track our work through

- Issue creation and addition to the board.
- Definition of properties.
- Updating issues and their properties as we work.

## Glossary {#e7738573bbfd4e10805ebab2e32058e4}

1. Projects: GitHub’s issue management feature, i.e., the Project Board.
2. Development: A project board metadata for linking branches and pull requests to issues.
3. Milestone: A project board metadata for tracking progress on a group of related issues.
4. Repository: This is where project files are stored. It tracks changes to the files and contains their revision history.
5. Metadata: Information on specific characteristics of an issue. E.g., Labels, Assignees, Repository, Projects, and Development.
6. Task List: Work on an issue can be broken down into smaller tasks on clickable checkboxes. These checkboxes make up the task list.

# Contributing to the Handbook {#4cbbb6f7416a43a3a495a7011abc4cc5}


Two major steps are needed to contribute to the handbook:

1. Create the document(s) on Notion.
2. Use GitHub Action to publish the document.

## Create the Document on Notion {#db5590b13da042b18c7728c426370f74}

1. **Navigate to the** [**Handbook Database**](https://www.notion.so/3dc8e0950bb7445b876d2b179a44ff1d)  **page**

	All documents in the handbook are created from this database. Ensure you create a status ID for your document if it doesnâ€™t belong to any existing ID.

2. **Create status ID**

	A status ID is required to publish only the documents you wish to publish on the website at that time. To create one:

	1. Hover over the database and a toolbar will appear.

3. **Add new document**

	2. Click on the **New** button.

		![](/notion_imgs/470757847.png)

	3. Enter the document title.
	4. Choose a **Category**.
	5. Choose the **Status** you added.
	6. Add slug (path name for the document) e.g., if your document is titled **General Onboarding**, the corresponding slug should be `/general-onboarding`.
	7. Add the contents of your document.

		:::caution
		
		Docu-notion is a tool that downloads Notion documents and converts them to markdown. However, it's important to note that not all blocks are supported by Docu-notion. For example, multi-column blocks are not supported.  You can review this **[Problem Internal Link]** to see what each block would look like when the document is published.

4. **Add document links to the Outline page**

	After creating your documents, you need to add links to them on the **[Problem Internal Link]** page. This ensures they appear in the correct order on the website's sidebar navigation when published. Follow these steps:

	1. Navigate to the **Outline** page.

		![](/notion_imgs/331298246.png)

	2. Locate the appropriate category page for your document and click the page link.
	3. If your documents are to be placed under a subcategory:
		1. Create a new page within the category page.
		2. Give the new page a title.
	4. Add the document link:
		1. Copy the URL of the document.
		2. Click on the category or subcategory where you want to add the link.
		3. Paste the URL and select **Link to Page**.

	5. Repeat steps 4a-4d for each document you want to add.
	6. Arrange the links in the desired order within their category or subcategory.

		:::tip
		
		The order of links on the **Outline** page determines the order in which documents appear in the sidebar navigation on the published website.

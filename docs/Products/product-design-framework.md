# Product Design Framework {#7a7f951f527d4d43a6d179ed15238fea}


## Shape {#9b43774a08f6461393a9a264ac4dd88e}

- **Set boundaries**
	- Determine how much time the idea is worth.
	- Define the problem to fit the time we plan to commit.
	- Determine the use case to build for.
	- Identify the gaps we could fill in the industry.
	- Flesh out the features that will fill those gaps.
- **Define elements**
	- Create a features priority list to decide those necessary for an MVP (Cycle 1).
	- Define those features' components (interactions) and their routes (where they lead to).
	- Create sketches using [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/files/team/1146665276092609078/all-projects?fuid=1290937344527095459). The sketches should contain the
		- Places, i.e., things you can navigate to, like screens, dialogues, or menus that pop up.
		- Affordances: Elements the user can act on, like buttons and fields. We consider interface copy to be an affordance, too. Reading it is an act that gives the user information for subsequent actions.
		- Connection lines: Show how the affordances take the user from place to place.
- **Eliminate rabbit holes**

	This includes unclear ideas and any unanswered questions.

	- Go over the elements you have built out with these questions as a guide
		- Does this require new technical work we’ve never done before?
		- Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
		- Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn’t come up with ourselves?
		- Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance so it doesn’t trip up the team?
	- Adjust the solution (features, components, and routes) accordingly.
	- Clearly define out-of-bound areas, i.e., solutions we won't work on.
	- Present to technical experts. Walk them through the idea and pose the question, "Is X possible in 6 weeks?” Where X is the MVP and its elements.
	- Create a pitch/design specification for the cycle.

## Build {#4256721742ba4815876b2a4e2e6e8e48}

- Identify the tasks needed to build out what we’ve detailed in the design specification.
- Populate the product-focused roadmap with those tasks.
- Create corresponding GitHub issues for each task.
- Build and test without focusing on bugs.
- Repeat the previous process to plan future cycles as we build.

## Document {#e0900acc7c554ae6b18b09383de38a7e}

- Record brainstorming activities in one place for future reference.
- Populate the product specification for the cycle before building.
- List the features on the appropriate page.
- Document the routes and components on the releases page.
